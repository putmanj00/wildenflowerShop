// ─── FAQ Items ──────────────────────────────

export const faqItems: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    id: 'faq-1',
    question: 'How does Wildenflower choose its makers?',
    answer: 'Every maker on Wildenflower is personally invited after we\'ve visited their studio, seen their process, and heard their story. We look for craft, intention, and heart — not volume or trend. If it\'s not made by hand with genuine care, it\'s not on Wildenflower.',
    category: 'getting-started',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-2',
    question: 'Are all items truly handmade?',
    answer: 'Every single item on Wildenflower is made by hand by a real person. We visit each maker\'s studio, watch them work, and hear their story before they join our community. No mass production, no factory shortcuts — just human hands and honest craft.',
    category: 'getting-started',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-3',
    question: 'How long does shipping take?',
    answer: 'Because every item is handmade, some pieces may need a few days to be carefully prepared and packed. Most orders ship within 3-5 business days and arrive within 7-10 days. We\'ll send you a thoughtful update at every step — no anxious tracking refreshes needed.',
    category: 'shipping',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-4',
    question: 'Can I request a custom piece from a maker?',
    answer: 'Many of our makers love custom commissions! You\'ll find a "Request Custom" option on maker profiles where it\'s available. Custom pieces take longer — usually 2-4 weeks — but the wait is part of the magic. You\'re watching something be made just for you.',
    category: 'makers',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-5',
    question: 'What is your return policy?',
    answer: 'We want every purchase to feel right. If something arrives damaged or isn\'t what you expected, reach out within 14 days and we\'ll make it right — whether that\'s a replacement, exchange, or refund. Because these are handmade pieces, slight variations from photos are part of their character, not a flaw.',
    category: 'returns',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-6',
    question: 'How are items packaged?',
    answer: 'With love and care. Our makers use sustainable, minimal packaging — recycled paper, cloth wraps, and biodegradable materials. Many include a small handwritten note. Receiving a Wildenflower parcel should feel like getting a gift from a friend, not a delivery from a warehouse.',
    category: 'shipping',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-7',
    question: 'How do I care for handmade items?',
    answer: 'Each product listing includes specific care instructions from the maker. In general: handmade pieces reward gentle treatment. Hand wash ceramics, keep leather out of direct sun, store crystals with intention. These items were made slowly — they deserve to be cared for slowly too.',
    category: 'returns',
  },
