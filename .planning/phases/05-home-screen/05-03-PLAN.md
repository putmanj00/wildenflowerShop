<objective>
Human visual verification of the completed Home screen against the projectVision mockup and the Phase 5 success criteria.

Purpose: Confirms brand fidelity and live data wiring before Phase 5 is closed. Claude cannot visually assess layout, font rendering, or the feel of pull-to-refresh.
Output: Approval to mark Phase 5 complete, or a list of issues for gap closure.

  <name>Visual verification: Home screen brand fidelity and live data</name>
  <action>Human validates the Home screen on Expo Web — live products, skeleton loading, pull-to-refresh, category navigation, HeroCard button, and brand styling against the projectVision mockup. No code changes — this checkpoint verifies the output of Plans 01–02.</action>
  <verify>Human confirms live products appear, skeleton flashes on load, pull-to-refresh triggers terracotta spinner, category taps switch to Browse tab, "Wander the Shop" button navigates to Browse, and visual appearance matches the parchment/serif/warm brand.</verify>
  <done>All Phase 5 success criteria confirmed: live Shopify products visible, loading/error/refresh states functional, navigation wired, visual brand fidelity approved.</done>
  <what-built>
Home screen fully wired to live Shopify data:
- Featured products fetched from "featured" Shopify collection (or newest 6 as fallback)
- 6 skeleton cards displayed during initial load
- Brand-voiced error state on fetch failure with terracotta "Try Again" button
- Pull-to-refresh (terracotta spinner) triggers product refetch
- Category chips navigate to Browse tab with category filter param
- HeroCard "Wander the Shop" button navigates to Browse unfiltered
- "See All" link navigates to Browse unfiltered
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server if not running:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Open in browser at http://localhost:8081

Check each item:

1. **Products visible** — Home screen shows product cards (not blank) after a brief load. Products should be real Shopify products (not the mock artisan products from the old mock-data.ts like "Hand-dyed Indigo Wrap").

2. **Skeleton loading state** — Hard-refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) and watch the Home screen. Six parchment-coloured placeholder cards should appear briefly before products load, in a 2-column layout matching the product grid.

3. **Brand styling** — Confirm:
   - Background is warm parchment (not white)
   - BotanicalHeader banner is visible at top
   - HeroCard shows tagline in italic serif on forest green background
   - "Wander the Shop" gold button is present on HeroCard
   - Category chips (tie-dye, leather, jewelry, etc.) appear in horizontal scroll
   - Product cards have warm earth-toned styling (no white/gray)
   - "Freshly Gathered" section title is present above products

4. **HeroCard button** — Tap "Wander the Shop" on the HeroCard. It should switch to the Browse tab.

5. **Category tap** — Tap any category chip (e.g. "Tie-Dye"). It should switch to the Browse tab. Note: Browse is still a stub — this is expected. The navigation itself should succeed (no error, tab switches).

6. **"See All" link** — Tap "See All" next to "Freshly Gathered". Should switch to Browse tab.

7. **Pull-to-refresh** — On the Home screen, pull down. A terracotta-coloured loading spinner should appear and products should reload. Release and confirm the spinner disappears and products remain.

8. **Compare to mockup** — Open `projectVision/wildenflowerHomeScreen.png` (or `wildenflower-mobileHome.png`). The layout (header → hero card → categories → divider → product grid) should match the mockup.

Report any visual discrepancies, broken navigation, missing elements, or TypeScript errors from the terminal.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass. Otherwise describe specific issues found (e.g., "skeleton not appearing", "category tap crashes", "wrong font", etc.) and Claude will create gap-closure tasks.</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
Phase 5 is complete when:
1. Live Shopify products are visible on Home screen (not mock data)
2. Loading skeleton, error state, and pull-to-refresh are functional
3. Category chips and HeroCard button navigate to Browse
4. Visual appearance matches the projectVision mockup (brand tokens, layout, typography)
5. Human verifier types "approved"
</success_criteria>

<output>
After approval, create `.planning/phases/05-home-screen/05-03-SUMMARY.md` following the summary template at @/Users/jamesputman/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md
