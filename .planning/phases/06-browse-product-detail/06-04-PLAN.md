  <name>Human verification: Browse + Product Detail brand fidelity and interaction flow</name>
  <what-built>
Browse screen (FilterChipRow + ProductGrid + skeleton loading + "Discover more" pagination) and Product Detail screen (image gallery + variant selector + sticky Add to Cart bottom bar). Home screen navigation fixed to use product handle. Both screens wired to live Shopify data.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run `npx expo start --web` and open http://localhost:8081 in a browser.

**Browse screen checks:**
1. Tap the Browse tab — confirm compact BotanicalHeader and "Wander the Shop" title appear
2. Confirm FilterChipRow shows: All, Tie-Dye, Leather, Jewelry, Artwork chips in horizontal scroll
3. Confirm "All" chip is active by default (dustyRose/terracotta visual distinction)
4. Tap "Leather" chip — confirm skeleton cards flash, then leather products appear in 2-column grid
5. Tap "All" chip — confirm all products return
6. If store has enough products: confirm "Discover more" button appears at bottom; tap it and confirm more products append below

**Product Detail checks (from Browse):**
7. Tap any product card — confirm URL changes to `/product/some-handle` (not a GID)
8. Confirm product title in terracotta serif, vendor in sage italic
9. Confirm image gallery shows product image full-width; if multiple images: swipe works; prev/next arrows visible on web
10. Confirm dot indicators below gallery match image count
11. Confirm variant option pills render (if product has options); confirm no option is pre-selected
12. Confirm bottom sticky bar shows price and button
13. Confirm button reads "Select options to add" when no variant selected
14. Select all options → confirm button changes to "Add to Cart"
15. Tap "Add to Cart" → confirm button briefly shows "Added!" then resets
16. Check cart tab — confirm item count badge increased

**Brand fidelity checks:**
17. All typography is serif (Playfair Display or Lora) — no sans-serif visible
18. Background is parchment (#F5EDD6) throughout — no pure white
19. All text colors are warm (terracotta, sage, earth) — no pure black
20. Empty state (if any collection has no products): warm copy, not generic "No items"
