<objective>
Validate the complete web baseline across all screens — confirming fonts, safe areas, shadows, and clean rendering.

Purpose: The three prior plans fix bugs and add infrastructure, but cannot self-verify visual rendering or platform behavior. A human must launch the app on Expo Web, navigate every screen, and confirm the web baseline is solid before Phase 2 begins. This checkpoint documents which screens were validated and any issues found.

Output: A validation checklist signed off by the user, covering all 12 screens. Any issues found are documented as follow-up items in STATE.md.

  <name>Task 1: Web baseline validation — all screens on Expo Web</name>
  <action>
Human validates the complete web baseline across all 12 screens. No code changes — this checkpoint verifies the output of Plans 01–03.
  </action>
  <verify>Human confirms app runs on Expo Web, all screens render, fonts display correctly, no shadow warnings in console, no content clipping.</verify>
  <done>All 12 screens render on Expo Web without errors; fonts, shadows, and safe areas work correctly on web.</done>
  <what-built>
Plans 01-03 implemented the following:
- Plan 01: Fixed font loading freeze bug in `app/_layout.tsx`; created `components/layout/FontErrorScreen.tsx` (on-brand error screen with retry button)
- Plan 02: Added Platform.select web shadow fallbacks to `constants/theme.ts` (all 4 shadow variants); fixed inline tab bar shadow in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- Plan 03: Created `components/layout/Screen.tsx` and `ScrollScreen.tsx`; updated all 12 screens to use the correct layout wrapper with SafeAreaView from react-native-safe-area-context
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the app on Expo Web:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --web
   ```
   Wait for the browser to open (or navigate to http://localhost:8081).

2. Check the browser console (DevTools → Console) — confirm:
   - No "shadow* style props are deprecated" warnings
   - No font loading errors
   - No SafeAreaView or layout errors

3. Navigate to each screen and confirm it renders without crashing:
   - [ ] Home (/) — fonts render as decorative serif headings and warm serif body
   - [ ] Browse (/browse) — renders without error
   - [ ] Favorites (/favorites) — renders without error
   - [ ] Cart (/cart) — renders without error
   - [ ] Profile (/profile) — renders without error
   - [ ] Product detail — navigate to any product card if clickable, or visit /product/test directly
   - [ ] Blog feed (/blog) — renders without error
   - [ ] Blog post detail (/blog/test) — renders without error
   - [ ] Maker profile (/maker/test) — renders without error
   - [ ] Checkout (/checkout) — renders without error
   - [ ] About (/about) — renders without error
   - [ ] FAQ (/faq) — renders without error

4. On the Home screen specifically, confirm:
   - Headings use Playfair Display (decorative serif with serifs visible)
   - Body text uses Lora (warm readable serif)
   - Cards have visible box shadows (not flat)
   - Bottom tab bar has a visible upward shadow separating it from content
   - Content does NOT clip behind browser chrome/address bar (SafeAreaView working)

5. Tab bar: tap each tab and confirm navigation works without errors.

Note: Most screens are still stub Views showing just a title text — that is expected. What matters is clean rendering with no crashes.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all screens render and the console is clean.
Or describe any issues found (e.g., "font warning still showing on browse screen", "checkout crashes") so they can be addressed before Phase 2.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

Human confirmation that:
1. App loads on Expo Web without errors
2. Fonts render correctly on the Home screen
3. No shadow deprecation warnings in browser console
4. All 12 screens render without crashing
5. Content is not clipped behind browser chrome (SafeAreaView working)

<success_criteria>
- All Phase 1 success criteria confirmed by human visual validation on Expo Web
- PLAT-01: `npx expo start --web` runs without errors; all screens render in browser
- PLAT-02: All screens use SafeAreaView from react-native-safe-area-context (verified visually — no clipping)
- ASSET-01: Fonts render correctly; font error state is handled (verified by app not freezing)
- Phase 1 is complete — Phase 2 (Shopify Service Layer) is unblocked
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-prerequisites/01-04-SUMMARY.md`
