<objective>
Human verification of Cart screen brand fidelity and end-to-end interaction flow. Confirms the complete add-to-cart → review cart → checkout path works on Expo Web before Phase 7 is closed.

Purpose: Phase gate before Phase 8. Human eyes confirm visual brand fidelity and the critical pre-checkout UX that automated checks cannot verify.
Output: Phase 7 approved and closed.

  <name>Human verification: Cart screen brand fidelity, interaction flow, and checkout path</name>
  <what-built>
Cart screen (app/(tabs)/cart.tsx) with: CartLineRow sub-component (thumbnail, title, variant, qty stepper, × remove), order summary (subtotal + shipping note), gold "Proceed to Checkout" button calling openCheckout(), empty state with "Start Discovering" CTA, loading state. All wired to live CartContext (Shopify mutations).
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run `npx expo start --web` and open http://localhost:8081 in a browser.

**Empty cart checks:**
1. Navigate to Cart tab with an empty cart — confirm botanical illustration placeholder and "Nothing here yet — but the best things take time." copy
2. Confirm "Start Discovering" gold button is visible below the copy
3. Tap "Start Discovering" — confirm it navigates to the Browse tab

**Populated cart checks:**
4. Add at least 2 different products to the cart (via Browse → Product Detail → "Add to Cart")
5. Navigate to Cart tab — confirm both line items appear as rows
6. Each row: product thumbnail image, product title in terracotta serif, variant title in sage, line price in gold, qty stepper, "×" button

**Quantity stepper checks:**
7. With a qty=1 item: confirm '−' stepper button is visually disabled (faded) and non-responsive to tap
8. Tap '+' on any item — confirm quantity increments and line price updates to match
9. Tap '+' again to reach qty=3, then tap '−' twice — confirm quantity decrements correctly; at qty=1, '−' becomes disabled again
10. Tap '×' on a line item — confirm item is removed from cart; if it was the last item, empty state appears

**Order summary and checkout checks:**
11. With items in cart: confirm sticky summary bar shows "Subtotal" + dollar amount derived from Shopify cart data
12. Confirm "Shipping & taxes calculated at checkout" note line appears below subtotal
13. Confirm "You're about to make someone's day." italic caption below the checkout button
14. Tap "Proceed to Checkout" — confirm it opens the Shopify checkout URL (browser navigates to Shopify's checkout page)

**Brand fidelity checks:**
15. Background is parchment (#F5EDD6) throughout — no pure white
16. All typography is serif (Playfair Display or Lora) — no sans-serif
17. Cart item titles in terracotta, variant in sage, prices in gold — no pure black text
18. "Proceed to Checkout" button is gold, not blue/green/generic
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all 18 checks pass, or describe specific issues found so they can be fixed before closing Phase 7.</resume-signal>
  <action>Run `npx expo start --web`, open http://localhost:8081, and follow the verification checklist above. Add products via Browse to test the populated cart flow.</action>
